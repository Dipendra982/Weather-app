Weather App

Introduction

The Weather App is a Java-based application that provides real-time weather updates, forecasts, and other meteorological data. This project was developed collaboratively as a team effort to enhance our skills in Java programming, API integration, and GUI design. The application is designed to fetch weather details from a reliable weather API and display them in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
